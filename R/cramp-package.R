#' CRAMP: **C**ovariance matrix testing using **RA**ndom **M**atrix **P**rojections
#'
#' The CRAMP package provides functions to perform hypothesis tests involving the covariance matrix of multivariate distributions. For the one-sample case, tests for uniformity and sphericity are provided. In the two sample case, the test is for equality of two covariance matrices. Functions to compute several traditional Gaussian likelihood-based and high-dimensional test statistics are provided in this package.
